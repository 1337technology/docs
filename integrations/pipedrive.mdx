# Connect Pipedrive to Sara

Connecting Pipedrive to Sara allows you to call Sara and log information directly in the CRM.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An active Pipedrive account
- Access to your Pipedrive account settings
- An active Sara account

The entire setup takes about 2-3 minutes.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Part 1: Getting Your API Key from Pipedrive

An API key is like a secure password that allows Sara to connect with your Pipedrive account. Here's how to find it:

#### 1. Open Pipedrive

Go to [pipedrive.com](https://pipedrive.com) and log into your account.

#### 2. Access Your Account Settings

In the top right corner of your Pipedrive screen, click on your **initials** (the circle with your letters in it). From the dropdown menu that appears, click on **Personal preferences**.

#### 3. Navigate to API Settings

At the top of the Personal preferences page, you'll see several tabs. Click on the **API** tab. Click the green **Copy** button next to your token to copy it to your clipboard.

#### Part 2: Connecting Sara to Pipedrive

Now that you have your API key, let's connect it to Sara.

#### 4. Open Sara

Go to [askforsara.com](https://askforsara.com) and log into your account.

#### 5. Navigate to Integrations

Once logged in, find and click on the **Pipedrive** integration option.

#### 6. Enter Your Company Domain

In the "Company Domain" field, enter just your company name from your Pipedrive URL.

**How to find your company name:**

- Look at your Pipedrive URL in your browser
- It will look like: `yourcompany.pipedrive.com`
- Enter only the `yourcompany` part (without `.pipedrive.com`)

**Example:** If your URL is `acme.pipedrive.com`, enter `acme`

#### 8. Connect Pipedrive

Click the **[CONNECT PIPEDRIVE]** button to finalize the connection.

#### 9. You're All Set!

Your Pipedrive account is now connected to Sara! You can now call Sara before meetings to prepare or after meetings to log information, and everything will be automatically saved in your Pipedrive CRM.

## What Happens Next?

Once connected, you can call Sara to:

- **Before a meeting:** Ask Sara to brief you on a contact or deal from your Pipedrive
- **After a meeting:** Tell Sara what happened, and she'll log notes and updates to the right contact or deal
- **Update deals:** Sara can update deal stages, add notes, and log activities automatically
- **Save time:** No more manual data entry - just tell Sara what happened and she handles the rest
