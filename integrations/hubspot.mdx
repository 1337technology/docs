# Connect HubSpot to Sara

Connecting HubSpot to Sara allows you to call Sara and log information directly in the CRM.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An active HubSpot account
- Access to your HubSpot account settings (you'll need permission to create Private Apps)
- An active Sara account

The entire setup takes about 3-5 minutes.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Part 1: Creating Your Private App in HubSpot

A Private App Access Token is like a secure password that allows Sara to connect with your HubSpot account. Here's how to create one:

<Note>
  **Not sure how to do this?** Click the **Watch Demo** button in Sara's HubSpot connection screen for a step-by-step video guide.
</Note>

#### 1. Open HubSpot Settings

Go to your HubSpot account and click the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the top right corner.

#### 2. Navigate to Private Apps

In the Settings menu:

- Look for the **Integrations** section in the left sidebar
- Click on **Private Apps**

#### 3. Create Your Private App

Click the **Create app **button and select**private**  to start setting up your connection.

#### 4. Configure App Name and Scopes

Give your app a name (for example, "Sara Integration") and then select the required permissions (scopes) that Sara needs to access your HubSpot data. These scopes determine what information Sara can read and update in your CRM.

Make sure to select all the necessary permissions for contacts, companies, deals, and appointments. Otherwise Sara won't be able to access the necessary information.

#### 5. Copy Your Access Token

After creating the app, HubSpot will generate your Private App **Access Token **(see screenshot aboove). It will start with `pat-na1-...`

Click the **Copy** button to copy this token to your clipboard. Keep this safe - you'll need it in the next step!

### Part 2: Connecting Sara to HubSpot

Now that you have your Private App Access Token, let's connect it to Sara.

#### 6. Open Sara and Navigate to HubSpot Integration

Go to [askforsara.com](https://askforsara.com), log into your account, and find the **HubSpot** integration option.

#### 7. Enter Your Access Token and Connect

In the "HubSpot Private App Access Token" field, paste the token you copied from HubSpot (the one starting with `pat-na1-...`).

Click the **[CONNECT HUBSPOT]** button to finalize the connection.

#### 8. You're All Set!

Your HubSpot account is now connected to Sara! You can now call Sara before meetings to prepare or after meetings to log information, and everything will be automatically saved in your HubSpot CRM.

## What Happens Next?

Once connected, you can call Sara to:

- **Before a meeting:** Ask Sara to brief you on a contact, company, or deal from your HubSpot
- **After a meeting:** Tell Sara what happened, and she'll log notes and updates to the right contact, company, or deal
- **Update deals:** Sara can update deal stages, add notes, and log activities automatically
- **Schedule follow-ups:** Sara can create appointments and reminders in your HubSpot calendar
- **Save time:** No more manual data entry - just tell Sara what happened and she handles the rest

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Connection Failed - Invalid Access Token">
  **What this means:** The access token you entered couldn't be verified.

  **How to fix it:**

  1. Go back to HubSpot Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
  2. Make sure you copied the entire token (it should start with `pat-na1-`)
  3. Copy the token again without any extra spaces
  4. Try pasting it into Sara again
  5. If you deleted or regenerated your Private App, you'll need to create a new one and get a new token
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I Don't See Private Apps in My Settings">
  **What this means:** Your HubSpot account may not have permissions to create Private Apps.

  **How to fix it:**

  1. Check with your HubSpot administrator to ensure you have the right permissions
  2. Some HubSpot accounts require "Super Admin" access to create Private Apps
  3. Ask your admin to either grant you permission or create the Private App for you
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm Not Sure Which Scopes to Select">
  **What this means:** When creating your Private App, you need to select the right permissions.

  **How to fix it:**

  1. Watch the demo video by clicking **Watch Demo** in Sara's HubSpot connection screen
  2. The video shows exactly which scopes you need to select
  3. Generally, Sara needs read and write access to: Contacts, Companies, Deals, and Appointments
  4. You can also refer to the "bereiken" screenshot for the exact scopes needed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My Token Stopped Working">
  **What this means:** Your Private App token may have been deleted, deactivated, or regenerated.

  **How to fix it:**

  1. Go to HubSpot Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
  2. Check if your Sara Private App still exists
  3. If it's been deleted, create a new one following the steps above
  4. If it exists but the token was regenerated, copy the new token and update it in Sara
