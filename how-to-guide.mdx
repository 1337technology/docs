## Tips for Better Results

### Speaking Clearly About Names

Sara sometimes has trouble catching people's names, especially unusual ones. Here's how to help her out:

- **Say the full name clearly:** "I met with Jennifer Martinez from Acme Corporation"
- **Spell it out if needed:** "That's Martinez, M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z"
- **Don't worry if you don't know the full name:** Just say what you know - "I spoke with Jennifer" or "talked to someone from Acme" works fine

<Tip>
The clearer you are with company names and full names, the better Sara can organize your meeting notes in the CRM.
</Tip>

### Find a Quiet Spot

Sara works best when she can hear you clearly. Try to avoid calling from:
- Busy coffee shops or restaurants
- Your car with the windows down
- Crowded conference halls
- Windy outdoor locations

If you must call from a noisier environment, speak a bit slower and closer to your phone.

### Give Sara Time to Respond

Sara usually responds within a few seconds, but sometimes she needs a moment to process what you've said.

**Normal:** Sara takes 3-5 seconds to respond - that's totally fine, she's thinking!

**Something's Wrong:** If Sara hasn't responded after 10 seconds, something might be off. Try:
- Asking "Sara, are you still there?" or "What are you doing?"
- Hanging up and calling again

<Warning>
If Sara consistently takes more than 10 seconds to respond, let your team know so they can check what's going on.
</Warning>

## Example Conversation

Here's what a typical call with Sara might sound like:

**You:** "Hey Sara, I just finished a meeting."

**Sara:** "Great! Tell me about it."

**You:** "I met with Jennifer Martinez from Acme Corporation. She's the VP of Sales. We talked about their current CRM challenges - they're struggling with data entry taking too much time. She seemed really interested in our automation features. Next step is to schedule a demo for next week with their IT team too."

**Sara:** "Got it! I'll log that meeting with Jennifer Martinez from Acme Corporation. Is there anything else you want me to add?"

**You:** "Nope, that's everything. Thanks!"

**Sara:** "All set! Your meeting is logged."
